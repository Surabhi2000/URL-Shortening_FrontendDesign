## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for Frontend Mentor for this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript was used.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
